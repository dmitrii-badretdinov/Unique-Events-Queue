# Task description
### Task 1
```
<param>int number</param>
<returns>string result<returns>
number > 0
``` 
* Language: C#  
* Returns a string that represents the input in a specific base-3 notation.  
* Contrary to the usual notation, the least significant digit should be on the left.  
* (0, 1, 2) should be ('I', 'A', 'V').
* Standard number-to-string conversion and string-reversal should not be used.

Examples:  
| 0 | I |
| 1 | A |
| 2 | V |
| 3 | IA |
| 11 | VIA|

### Task 2 
```
<param>string input</param>
<returns>int number<returns>

Do the conversion opposite to the previous task. Restrictions are the same.

Overall time limit: 8 hours.
