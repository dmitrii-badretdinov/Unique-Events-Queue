# Task description

### Task 1

* Return a string that represents the positive number in a specific base-3 notation.  
* Contrary to the usual notation, the least significant digit should be on the left.  
* (0, 1, 2) should be ('I', 'A', 'V').
* Standard number-to-string conversion and string-reversal should not be used.

Examples: 
|Number | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | I |
| 1 | A |
| 2 | V |
| 3 | IA |
| 11 | VIA|

### Task 2 

Do the conversion opposite to the previous task. Restrictions are the same.

Overall time limit: 8 hours.
