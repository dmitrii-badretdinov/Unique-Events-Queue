Specification {
A client-server app with a search string and results. 
Search on the server.
REST API.

Tech stack {
	Vue frontend
	.NET Web API backend
}
}

Done things {
Change the data architecture to have one class. Implement the search functions for transitive and non-transitive fields.
The further development was done in one sitting, so please refer to the commits on June 6th for details.
Seems like the data classes for parsing JSON can hold additional variables when the initial JSON file is still properly parsed.
Server sends a dummy json back.
Clients sends a request to the server.
Changed the default server to have a custom API sequence.
Changed the default client to send a search request to the server.
Successfully ran local default server from the .NET Web API template.
Successfully ran local default client on Vue and Node.js.
As there was no client-server manual that covered both sides properly, I decided to go with .NET backend and the frontend solution for simple cases - Vue.
In order to deliver the solution faster, I decided to host client and server parts in a single Visual Studio project if necessary.
	Hosting client and server in different projects is bound to add more tasks, and I already have enough tasks.
The hosting side will be handled AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Preliminary choice of the server is the cheapest AWS EC2. Or maybe I'll have a free one because of the 1-year free tier.
Clarified why my internship project used both Node.js and .NET as backends. Turns out Node.js was used for the server-side rendering and to train me.
Brushed up on Angular.
Set up the repository. Put the main and develop branches for the sake of the git flow.
